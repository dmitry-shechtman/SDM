General info:
Digic IV, dryos, propset 2 (there may be digic IV specific stuff, but nothing found so far)
14.7mp raw 4480*3348 12 bits/pixel
Video is h264 NOT mjpeg
ND filter only, NO iris

Booting:
Encoded diskboot required, FI2 "firm update" supported.
With diskboot camera will always boot in play mode. Press halfshoot to switch to record.
With FI2, you must boot in play mode in order to access the firm update menu.
FI2 is encoded with the same parameters as SX10. (digic IV)

Display:
Live view is 360x240 
Bitmap buffer is 720x240
Bitmap color palette is different from other cameras. 

Buttons:
Direct print button is the ALT button. This can be assigned a function in the
original canon firmware. Hold it down to access the canon firmware function
Other keys use the standard mapping for cameras without an erase button.

Features known BROKEN or NOT supported:
Zebra
Edge overlay
Custom curves
video compression overrides
Microphone mute/unmute
Jogdial control from CHDK
Many other things are untested.

Other issues:
Pressing the shutter quickly with overrides enabled may result in incorrect white
balance. It may also cause issues if the flash is automatically triggered.
